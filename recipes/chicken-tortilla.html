        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This chicken tortilla soup is not a fast recipe, but it is one of the greatest chicken soup experiences known to man. The smoky, spicy, slowly simmered tomato chicken broth is made from scratch, and the soup is topped with all your favorite garnishes: toasted tortilla strips, sour cream, avocado, cilantro, lime, and crumbled Mexican cheese.</p>
        <p>Just when you think you’ve posted a video for every single world-famous, iconic chicken soup there is, someone asks for chicken tortilla, and you realize you haven’t. Seriously, what list of the greatest chicken soups of all time would not include this?</p>
        <p>If there were a Mount Rushmore for chicken soups, this is on it. Although, I’m guessing carving a bowl of soup into a rock mountain face would be a lot tougher than a face. Anyway, the point is, this is a really good soup.</p>
        <p>I hope you find the time to make it from scratch, but if you don’t, you’ll still be able to experience most of the awesomeness. If you use some high-quality chicken broth, and find some not-terribly-dry cooked chicken, you should be in decent shape. We’ll even let you break up some store-bought tortilla chips to finish the soup if you have to, but it’s so much better if you make your own crispy noodle-like strips. </p>
        <p>Either way, this is a bucket-list chicken soup, and I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy! </p>
